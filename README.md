# A space mod to rival the rest. 
It has a number of unique properties:

 - It is set in a solar system in a parallel universe so that I could have much more creative freedom.
 - Each planet has a unique hostility, for example the closest planet to the "earth"  has huge dust storms and is covered almost exclusively in sand.
 - But to counter the hostilities that each planet has a unique resource or better access to a hard to get resource. I'm not going to do the same as galacticraft where you need a resource for 1 planet to go to another, that is boring and repetitive.
 - In between planets ``Anomalies" will spawn these are physics defying space oddities. things such as non euclidean asteroids, worm hole clusters, and gravitational wonders.
 - All tied together with a music system to play music based on what's happening instead of normal minecraft music that is based on location, this involves audio cues for storms and anomalies.

It does have more features though these are really the corner stones of what makes Nebular unique, any suggestions are welcome
